# How to contribute

Here you will find information about contributing to the Sustainability team.

## Contribute to the Sustainability handbook

Our handbook is built using GitHub in [this repository](https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability). 

You can contribute to the handbook by creating issues. You can also submit pull requests as you would normally do on GitHub.

If youâ€™re not used to working with GitHub and you have access to our GitHub repo, you can also edit, or even add, pages there. Please refer to the [readme file](https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability/blob/trunk/README.md) for more information.
