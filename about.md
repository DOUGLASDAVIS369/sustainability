# About the team 

The WordPress Sustainability Team works towards embeding sustainable practices into WordPress to ensure the longevity of the project. 

To do so, we focus our efforts on the 3 pillars of sustainability: 

- **Social:** Finding ways to increase the diversity and wellbeing of the WordPress community.
- **Environmental:** Reducing energy and waste consumption in the development and usage of the WordPress software and its community activities.
- **Economical:** Finding ways to economically support contributions to the WordPress Project for those who need it.


## When do we meet

The WordPress Sustainability Team meets almost every Friday at 12:00 UTC in the [#sustainability](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/sustainability/) on the Make WordPress Slack and everyone is welcome! 

Please take a look at the [#Make WordPress Meeting Agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/) to check for the next date. 


## Who are we

We are a very young team eager to make the WordPress Project a leader in sustainability. We have very different backgrounds: developers, designers, writers, communicators... 

But, over all that, we are WordPress software and community enthusiasts.

## Our (short) History

The WordPress Sustainability [Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/sustainability/) was born after a question set forth by ([Nora Ferreirós](https://profiles.wordpress.org/noradriana/) at the closing conversation with Matt Mullenweg and Josepha Haden Chomphosy at WCEU Porto 2022. 

One year later, at WCEU Athens 2023 Contributor Day, the official Make WordPress Sustainability Team was born. You can read the whole story in [this post](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/2023/09/06/how-the-wordpress-sustainability-team-was-born-during-wordcamp-europe-2023/). 


## Our ongoing projects

We are currently working in several projects. You can check them on our [Github issues](https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability/issues) or [roadmap projects](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/134/views/1). 

If you find a project you would like to contribute, feel free to assign it to yourself and start there!

And if you want to start a project that is not already on our wish list, create a new issue on [Github](https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability/issues) and leave a comment on the next [Team Meeting Agenda post](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/). We would love to join you! :)
