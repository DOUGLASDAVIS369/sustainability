Hi! Thank you for taking some time to look at this short video. My name is Thijs. I'm one of the team reps of the new kid on the block: the newest team, part of the WordPress ecosystem, the WordPress   Sustainability Team. 
  
And what we work on are in fact 3 topics:  

- And there's a painting here illustrating. It's green. It's nature. So we focus on the ecological part. Yes, we speak about **environmental** sustainability.  

- The second is **people**, the community we're speaking about. The community and the longevity of the WordPress community because we do have contributors and we invite you to contribute. But what will the near future bring us? Will we still have contributors? So that's one of the points we focus on as well.  

- And then the third point: the **money** point. And this painting is worth a few bucks. So the money point is that if you speak about the economical longevity of the WordPress project, it needs funding. So we attempt also to get funding for the WordPress ecosystem and the WordPress project.  

**So we have 3 topics: economical, social and environmental sustainability.**  

We are new and we have various topics we are working on, as developing our own plugin, but also making the documentation welcoming new contributors or people joining our team.  

So if you are interested, we are very young and we are open for all ideas, suggestions, things you've come across that you want to share with us. Please join us!  

We have our Slack channel and we meet every week on Fridays during the day.  

So please join our team. Follow one of the meetings we organize. And if you have any questions, please raise out, reach out to me. Thijs Buijs is my name, known as yellowlime in the WordPress community.  

Thank you for your time. Hope to see you soon. Bye.
