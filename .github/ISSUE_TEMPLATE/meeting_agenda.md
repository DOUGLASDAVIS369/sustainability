_This week’s meeting will be hosted by MEETING_HOST._

Hello everyone. Welcome to the WordPress Sustainability Team Meeting! :calendar: 

Sustainability Team meetings start at [12:00 UTC bi-weekly on Thursdays](https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/#sustainability). Anyone is welcome to contribute to the meeting by commenting in Slack threads during the meeting and throughout the following days. Meeting notes will be published by the following Tuesday to also incorporate these asynchronous conversations.

### :mega: Roll Call! 
Who is joining us today? Please say hello, and share a flag or your favorite emoji! Also, please note your WordPress.org profile username as we will use this to record attendees in the notes.

Feel welcome to introduce yourself briefly and share your region (in the thread) :thread:

If you are attending asynchronously, please still add your details to the thread above :point_up_2: It helps to add (async) after your name to reflect on the timings for meetings and how as a team, we can encourage people from across all time zones to be able to participate.
