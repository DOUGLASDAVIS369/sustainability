# Sponsors/Fundraising

When you’re fundraising for the event, search sponsors that "[aren’t buying advertising, they’re supporting the WordPress project](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/fundraising/#at-the-event)". 

Securing sponsorship from local businesses or communities is one way of adding a ***sustainability*** tag. Adopting these recommendations lets you turn fundraising into a sustainability-tag-cloud while helping your sponsors be more environmentally aware during your event (and beyond!)

- Find local sponsors.
- Reach out to public transport operators that can sponsor the event via discounts or special offers. 
- Request sponsors to minimize physical swag and favor ones that offer software licenses, one big prize, or sustainable items.
- Encourage sponsors to avoid packing flyers or printed materials in the welcome bag when they display the information at the booth.
- Give sponsors clear requirements about the equipment available on site. Mention which advertising materials are preferred from a sustainability perspective.
- If your sponsor brings bottles as swag, locate their booth near a water refill point.
- Provide information about recycling facilities.
    - If a sponsor ships furniture or brings swag, include local donating options.
