# Inspiration

WordCamps in Bordeaux, Brighton, Rotterdam, London, and other locations have implemented several sustainable measures, including picking a venue close to public transportation, offering vegan-only menus, and more.

Here are our favorites: 

- WordCamp Brighton 2016 swag included reusable bottles and coffee cups; they served vegetarian and vegan catering in biodegradable plates and cutlery. 
- WordCamp London 2019 recycled WordCamp Brighton’s sustainability measures.  
- The organizers of WordCamp Netherlands 2022 chose  Burgers' Zoo as their venue thanks to their involvement in protecting a nature reserve in Belize; they hosted several speakers who explored reducing footprints from WordPress sites; and donated the leftovers from the vegetarian catering to a local food bank. 
- [WordCamp Switzerland 2023](https://app.slack.com/client/T024MFP4J/C03JNV77Y57) included a “Do you want a T-shirt, Yes (size) or No” question in the ticket purchase process; closed the ticket sale early to order the correct amount of food; and served lunch in the in-house restaurant (complete with plates and cutlery). They published a comprehensive [venue and access](https://switzerland.wordcamp.org/2023/venue-and-access/) page that also covered accessibility topics. 
- [WordCamp Kochi 2019](https://kochi.wordcamp.org/2019/gearing-up-for-an-an-eco-friendly-wordcamp-kochi/) used cloth banners instead of vinyl banners and installed screens across the venue so sponsors could ditch banners altogether.
- In WordCamp Europe, banners are repurposed as reusable bags or aprons for future events gifts. Small-medium business sponsors aren’t allowed to bring any marketing material that doesn’t fit on their table.
