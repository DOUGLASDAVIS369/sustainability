How to attract sponsors, speakers, and attendees using your online and offline assets, and other sustainability marketing tips. 

- Build a sustainable and accessible website for the event.
- Spend your publication budget on local companies and services.
- Set a deadline for registration. Among other things, it allows you to avoid food waste.
- Use a digital-only ticketing system. 
- Let your followers know about the sustainability aspect of the event—share the information on digital channels.
- Include useful information—like recycling or donation points—on the event’s website and host messages. 
- Run a survey (before or after the event) to gather opinions and suggestions for making events more sustainable.
- Minimize the number of posters and banners and use recycled paper. Consider using timeless design. 
- Reuse banners and reduce single-use. Prefer recyclable materials from unsustainable sources.
- Provide marketing materials for sponsors via a sustainable local provider.
