# Traveling

After you’ve selected a [venue](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/handbook/sustainable-events/venue/), it’s time to share information with attendees and sponsors.

We can consider several scales of WordCamp events, and each has distinct location selection criteria, and needs for information.

**City/ Local Events** - travel is likely to be less than one day, and public transport in many locations will be a viable options for attendees.
**National Events** - travel can include public transport, but road maybe a necessary option for some attendees and travel time will be a factor.
**Regional Events** (eg WCEU, WCAsia) - Travel will incliude distances in exces of several hundred km, and in many cases flights will be necessary, or much more convenient. Travel information and advice will need to acknowledge flights.

- Create a ***Traveling to*** page: 
    - Promote train, coach, and carpooling over flights.
    - Provide links to relevant train and coach services sites. 
    - Consider creating a communication channel where attendees can arrange carpooling.
    - Add links to sustainable travel advice sites.
- Create a ***Getting around*** page: 
    - Promote walking, bike rental, public transport, and carpooling to commute around the city.
    - Include information about private shuttles when relevant to the program.
    - Suggest sponsors send materials in advance so they can arrive by public transport.
- Look for discounts or offers regarding traveling to and getting around. Avoid promoting airlines' giveaways.
