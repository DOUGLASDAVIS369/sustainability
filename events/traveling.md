# Traveling

After you’ve selected a venue, it’s time to share information with attendees and sponsors.

- Create a ***Traveling to*** page: 
    - Promote train, coach, and carpooling over flights.
    - Provide links to relevant train and coach services sites. 
    - Consider creating a communication channel where attendees can arrange carpooling.
    - Add links to sustainable travel advice sites.
- Create a ***Getting around*** page: 
    - Promote walking, bike rental, public transport, and carpooling to commute around the city.
    - Include information about private shuttles when relevant to the program.
    - Suggest sponsors send materials in advance so they can arrive by public transport.
- Look for discounts or offers regarding traveling to and getting around. Avoid promoting airlines' giveaways.
