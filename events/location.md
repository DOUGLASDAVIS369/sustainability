# Location

When organizing a national or local event, consider the following aspects: 

Favor cities that have

- Excellent low-carbon long-haul travel links (like trains).
- Efficient, reliable, and accessible public transport (check out the [traveling](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/handbook/sustainable-events/traveling/) section for more information).
- Thoughtful environmental sustainability policies.
