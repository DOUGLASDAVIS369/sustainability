# Venue

On top of [cost, capacity, internet connection](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/venue-and-date/#choosing-a-venue), and [accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/venue-accessibility-checklist/), you should consider the sustainability status of the eventâ€™s chosen venue. 

Here are some criteria to support your research:

Prioritize venues with sustainability measures already in place, like:

- Use of renewable energy.
- Energy efficiency.
- Recycling facilities.
- Sustainable certifications.
- Active involvement in sustainable causes, like those mentioned in the [Inspiration](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/handbook/sustainable-events/inspiration/) Section.

Other things that give a venue extra points: 

- Well-connected via public transport. Consider using private shuttles at/to a meeting point only when necessary like late-night events. 
- Big enough to host all the events under the same roof. Otherwise, find nearby locations or venues that offer good public transport connections.
- Ensure wayfinding at the venue includes clear directions to public transport. 
- In-house restaurant service that could manage the catering and reduce waste.
- A system for refilling water bottles that doesn't rely on drums.
- Recycling boxes/stations in all event rooms. Take catering into consideration. If the venue can't assist with the disposal, recruit volunteers to help clean up. Remember to bring gloves.
